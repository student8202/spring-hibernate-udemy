1. Dependency Injection
The dependency inversion priciple.
The client delegates to calls to another object the responsibility of providing its dependencies.
Example: 1. give me a "Car" object <-> Car Factory (all the different parts for the car: the tires, the seats, so on)
	2. "dependency" same thing as "helper objects". So they inject the engine, they inject the tires.
---------------------------------------------
* Spring Container: primary functions
	1. Create and manage objects (Inversion of Control)
	2. Inject object's dependencies (Dependency Injection)
---------------------------------------------
* Development Process - constructor Injection
	1. Define the dependency interface and class
	2. Create a constructor in your class for injections
	3. Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file
---------------------------------------------
* The Spring Framework will perform operations behind the scenes for you
Explain: When Spring Container run -> applicationContext.xml ->
every beans will run step by step -> create the object (bean) and so on
	
	<!-- step 1 instance object -->
	<bean id="myFortuneService"
		class="com.hcode.springdemo.HappyFortuneService">
	</bean>
	<!-- step 2 inject another object by constructor -->
	<bean id="myCoach"
		class="com.hcode.springdemo.BaseballCoach">
		<constructor-arg ref="myFortuneService"/>
	</bean>
	
	1. instance object:
	HappyFortuneService myFortuneService = new HappyFortuneService();
	2. inject another object by constructor
	BaseballCoach myCoach = new BaseballCoach(myFortuneService);

FAQ: What is the purpose for the no arg constructor?



Question:
I was wondering why you created a no arg constructor? I thought that they are implied by Java and only required when you also have an overloaded constructor. Or is this a Spring specific thing?

When you don’t define any constructor in your class, compiler defines default one for you, however when you declare any constructor (in your example you have already defined a parameterized constructor), compiler doesn’t do it for you.

Since you have defined a constructor in class code, compiler didn’t create default one. While creating object you are invoking default one, which doesn’t exist in class code. Then the code gives an compilation error.

* Inside class: copy qualified name (get class package)
