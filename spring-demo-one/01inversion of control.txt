1. Java Inversion control
The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.

sumary: outsource to an object factory
example: with a very rough prototype

My App <-> getDailyWorkout() <-> BaseballCoach

_ App should be configurable
_ Easily change the coach for another sport
	Hockey, Cricket, Tennis, Gymnastics, etc,...

2. Spring Inversion of Control
Spring (Object Factory)
* Primary functions:
	1. Create and manage objects (Inversion of Control)
	2. Inject object's dependencies (Dependency Injection)
* Spring Development Process
	1. Configure your Spring Beans
	2. Create a Spring Container
	3. Retrieve Beans from Spring Container
* Spring container is generically known as ApplicationContext
* What is a Spring Bean?
	When Java object are created by the Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".
	Spring Beans are created from normal Java classes... just like Java objects.
